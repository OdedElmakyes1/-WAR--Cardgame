# -WAR--Cardgame
Hi my name is Oded. I'm here to explain to you about the project you're about to see. I built a "war" card game Game Instructions: Distribute a deck of cards in half to each player. In each turn each player draws a card from his deck and displays it on the table. The player with the larger card wins the round. If both players draw the same card then there is a "war" and the fun begins :) Wish you a pleasant use :)
